# At startup, xsettingsd reads its configuration from $HOME/.xsettingsd by default.
# If it encounters any errors, it exits; otherwise it becomes the XSETTINGS manager on all screens.
# After modifying the .xsettingsd file, you can trigger a configuration reload by sending a
# HUP signal to xsettingsd, e.g. killall -HUP xsettingsd
# Source: https://github.com/derat/xsettingsd/wiki/Installation
killall -HUP xsettingsd
